                <p>Pig is played by using a few simple steps. First, the die is rolled to get a number.</p>
                <p>If the number is between 2 to 6 then the player can take the points on has and roll again to get more.</p>
                <p>However, if the player gets a 1 then the player scores a 0 for that round. The next player will get to roll.</p>

                <h3>RULES</h3>
                <p>The rules of the game are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When the player rolls a 2 - 6, the dice score is added to their turn total and they can continue to play.</li>
                <li>When a player rolls a 1, their total score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>When the player chooses to "hold"(pass their turn), their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>The player who first scores 100 or more points wins the game.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Try your luck!!!</p>
